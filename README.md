# UFO_Challenge

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to use Javascript to filter through a table filled with UFO data sightings, allowing users to better refine their searches and populate the UFO sighting table data with customized information. 


## Results

In order to perform a search, enter the exact date in order to filter the UFO sighting data and press "Filter Table":
![UFODataFilter1](https://github.com/tylerfallon/UFO_Challenge/blob/main/static/images/ufo1.png?raw=true)

In order to clear the filters and populate the table with all of the data again after performing a search, clear the form. It will show gray sample text that says "1/10/2010", but this can simply be ignored, as it does not cause a filtered search to occur. Pressing "Filter Table" will remove all filters and repopulate the complete data in the table, as shown below:
